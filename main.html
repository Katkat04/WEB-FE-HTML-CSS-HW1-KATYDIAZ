                <h2>About me👀</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a 10th-semester student of Computer and Systems Engineering at Universidad del Norte.
                    With technical skills and experience in languages such as Python and Flutter, the latter has allowed me to develop a base when creating high-quality user interfaces. 
                    I consider myself a reliable person, with leadership skills, time management, and a strong sense of responsibility. I am competitive, and creative and have assertive communication skills.
                    I developed these competencies through participating in various student leadership and volunteer activities over the past five years.
                    In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy cooking, music, and exploring topics such as biology, history, and languages.
                    In the long term, I see myself working as a project management or IT management professional, roles that allow me to apply my skills to lead teams and achieve strategic goals.
                    In the medium term, I aspire to have the necessary resources to found an application development company in Colombia, where I can materialize my best ideas.
